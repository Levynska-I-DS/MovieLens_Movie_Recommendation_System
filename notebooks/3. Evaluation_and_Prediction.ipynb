    "# Movie Recommendation System / Evaluation and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the functionality of a movie recommendation system using different recommendation strategies. The system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and new movie recommendations to provide a comprehensive list of suggestions for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data**: The notebook starts by loading cleaned movie and rating data. The data is used to train and evaluate recommendation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading the Best Model**: An SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model is loaded from a file. This model has been trained on the data and will be used to generate collaborative filtering recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Functions**:\n",
    "   - **Collaborative Filtering Recommendations**: Generates movie recommendations based on user ratings and predictions made by the SVD model.\n",
    "   - **Content-Based Recommendations**: Suggests movies similar to those the user has liked in the past, based on movie genres.\n",
    "   - **New Movie Recommendations**: Provides a list of newly released or unrated movies that the user might be interested in.\n",
    "   - **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and new movie recommendations to provide a diverse set of suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaborative Filtering**: The SVD model predicts ratings for movies the user has not yet watched. Movies with the highest predicted ratings are recommended.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes the genres of movies the user has previously rated and suggests new movies with similar genres that the user hasn't watched.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **New Movie Recommendations**: Suggests movies that have not been rated yet, allowing users to explore new content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines the above three strategies to provide a well-rounded list of recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to generate recommendations for a user with `user_id = 1`. The results include:\n",
    "- Collaborative filtering recommendations\n",
    "- Content-based recommendations\n",
    "- New movie recommendations\n",
    "- A hybrid list combining all the above strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to modify the `user_id` and the number of recommendations to see different results.\n",
    "\n"
