    "### Interface Method for Machine Learning Model with GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed description and usage instructions for the graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with the machine learning model used for movie recommendations. The GUI is designed to facilitate user interaction with the recommendation system in a user-friendly manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Purpose of the GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "The GUI allows users to:\n",
    "- Enter their user ID to receive personalized movie recommendations.\n",
    "- View recommended movies along with their titles, overviews, posters, and ratings.\n",
    "- Interact with the recommendation system without needing to directly interact with the model or data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. GUI Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The GUI is implemented using PyQt5 and includes the following components:\n",
    "- **User ID Input**: A text box where users can enter their user ID.\n",
    "- **Recommendation Button**: A button to trigger the recommendation process.\n",
    "- **Recommendations Display**: A scrollable area where the recommended movies are displayed, including their titles, overviews, posters, and ratings.\n",
    "- **Exit Button**: A button to close the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Running the GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the GUI, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Required Packages**:\n",
    "   Ensure you have all required Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install pyqt5 pandas numpy requests surprise \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare Data Files:**  \n",
    "Make sure you have the necessary data files (ratings.csv, movies.csv, links.csv) in the data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load the Model:**\n",
    "Ensure the trained model file (final_svd_model.pkl) is present in the same directory as the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the Python Script:**\n",
    "Save the provided Python code into a file named movie_recommender_gui.py and execute it from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python movie_recommender_gui.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "This command will start the GUI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Code for the GUI\n",
    "The GUI code is implemented in the Python script movie_recommender_gui.py. This script sets up the PyQt5 application, loads the necessary data and model, and provides the functionality for generating and displaying movie recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief overview of the code in movie_recommender_gui.py:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imports:** Import required libraries such as PyQt5, pandas, numpy, and requests.\n",
    "- **Data Loading:** Load data files and the trained model.\n",
    "- **Movie Recommendation Function:** Define the function to generate movie recommendations based on the user ID.\n",
    "- **GUI Class:** Implement the PyQt5 GUI class, including methods for setting up the interface, handling user input, generating recommendations, and displaying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Integration with the Recommendation System\n",
    "The GUI interacts with the recommendation system by:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Receiving the user ID input from the user.\n",
    "-  Using the machine learning model to generate recommendations based on this user ID.\n",
    "-  Fetching additional movie information from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.\n",
    "-  Displaying the recommendations in the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Notes\n",
    "Ensure all required files (data files and model) are in the correct directory before running the script.\n",
    "Modify the API key and file paths as needed to match your environment.\n"
