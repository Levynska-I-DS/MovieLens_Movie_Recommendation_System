    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore and evaluate several recommendation algorithms using the `Surprise` library, a popular tool for building and evaluating recommender systems. Our objective is to train and assess different recommendation models, compare their performance, and identify the best-performing model based on specific metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: \n",
    "   - We start by loading the movie and rating data from CSV files. These datasets contain information about movies and user ratings, which are crucial for training and evaluating our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Processing**:\n",
    "   - Using the `Surprise` library, we prepare the data by creating a `Dataset` object from the ratings data and splitting it into training and test sets. Additionally, we create a sparse matrix representation of the ratings to optimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - We define and train three recommendation models:\n",
    "     - **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**: A matrix factorization technique.\n",
    "     - **NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization)**: Another matrix factorization method that ensures all factors are non-negative.\n",
    "     - **BaselineOnly**: A baseline model that predicts ratings based on user and item biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - We compute two key performance metrics for each model:\n",
    "     - **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors.\n",
    "     - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of the absolute errors.\n",
    "   - These metrics are stored and printed for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Selection**:\n",
    "   - We identify the best model based on the RMSE score. The model with the lowest RMSE is considered the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Saving and Loading**:\n",
    "   - The best-performing model is saved using `pickle` for future use. This allows us to reload the model later for generating recommendations or other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code performs the steps outlined above:\n",
    "1. Imports necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Loads and prepares the data.\n",
    "3. Defines and trains multiple recommendation models.\n",
    "4. Evaluates and compares model performance.\n",
    "5. Saves the best-performing model for future use.\n"
